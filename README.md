## Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression

This repository contains code for implementing linear regression models using various approaches, including NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and gradient descent. The goal is to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this task is stored in a CSV file named `tvmarketing.csv`. It contains two columns: `TV` for TV marketing expenses and `Sales` for the corresponding sales amount.

### Table of Contents

1. **Open the Dataset and State the Problem**: Load the dataset and define the problem statement.
2. **Linear Regression in Python with NumPy and Scikit-Learn**:
   - Implement linear regression using NumPy.
   - Implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn.
3. **Linear Regression using Gradient Descent**:
   - Define the cost function and partial derivatives.
   - Implement gradient descent to optimize the linear regression model.
4. **Comparison with Other Algorithms**: Compare linear regression with at least one other algorithm.
5. **FastAPI Endpoint for Prediction**: Set up an endpoint for making predictions using the trained model.
